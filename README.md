# Neural-Net-in-C

This project is part of my assignment for the Machine Learning course at BITS Pilani. 

We were asked to implement a neural network in C without using any external libraries. It has to be generalized to have an arbritrary number of layers, ordering of activation functions, and has to be robust to different datasets. 

This project helped me learn the intricacies and difficulties that one experiences when trying to build a neural network from scratch. 

The course required me to submit the code in one file, and hence, I have not created separate files for the functions.
